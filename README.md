dotfiles
========
My personal linux config files

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6524/ss.png)

## Installation
``` sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/HokieGeek/dotfiles
dotfiles/setup.sh
```

## Philosophy
I prefer to KISS as much as possible. All I need is a terminal and a browser and I've got all I need for 99% of what I do. I prefer smaller laptops so I try to take advantage of as much real estate as I can.

I keep the look and feel minimal so that it's less distracting so, to that end, the "color scheme" is dark with some gray shadings and a single color used by tmux and the conky bar up top. The script `bin/schemecolor` will sed the indicated color into my tmux.conf and xmonad.hs and will reload both so that I can change the color on-the-fly.

## Features

### chrome
Running a dark theme and using the cVim plugin to use vim bindings. This makes me very happy.

### vim

### st
Nothing to be done here for simple terminal, of course, other than setting the font to DejaVu Sans Mono

### tmux
Simple statusbar that just shows currently open terminals and an identifier for the current pane.

Wrote a vim plugin that integrates with tmux somewhat.

It is exec'ed by the shell upon login.

### zsh
Ported my bash prompt which displays information such as git and mercurial repository status and flags if the previous command returned a non-zero value and/or if a process is currently backgrounded.

### xmonad
My focus was to enable layouts that let me take advantage of my small laptop screen in a way that most benefits what I am currently working on. I couple that with a good number of custom keybindings so that I don't have to use the mouse to interact with the window manager. I also have been making pretty heavy use of `dmenu` to provide me some extra control.

Using `dzen2` to display the workspaces.

Also using `dmenu` for some application launchers as well as the selector which lets me change the color theme.

##### A few sample custom key bindings that I love
| Binding | What it does |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Super+n | Switches to the next empty workspace |
| Super+Alt+n | Opens a browser window in the next available empty workspace |
| Super+Shift+n | Shifts active window to the next empty workspace |
| Super+Tab | Switches to the previous workspace |
| Super+Ctrl+[WS#] | Swaps current workspace with indicated workspace |

### conky + dzen2
Displaying statistics such as time, IP addresses, CPU use, battery life, etc.
